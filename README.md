This repository provides a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system, designed to secure APIs and web applications. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. This README provides an overview of the repository structure, installation instructions, and basic usage guidelines.

Features
